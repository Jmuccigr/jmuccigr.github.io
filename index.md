## Classics

There are many of these sites, but here’s a (very) short list to get you started:
-   [Drew Classics department homepage](http://www.drew.edu/classics/?)
-   [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/)
-   [A list of undergraduate programs in Classics](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Jmuccigr/classics_programs/a39a4d38ef2b7ceff4f696fec57979086ce0aa9d/Undergrad_Classics.html)

## Archaeology

Once again there are a lot of sites out there, but here’s another starter list:
-   Did you miss the links above for our archaeological dig in [Umbria](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/vicusadmartis/) ?
-   The [Drew Archaeology minor homepage](http://www.drew.edu/anthropology/archaeology-minor)

## Current Projects

Currently in the works:
-   [Database of Roman temples](http://romeresearchgroup.org/mapping/) (DH, mapping stuff)
-   Computer-aided connoisseurship (“Bitsly”, and very back-burner)
-   See the next section

## Computing

-   I am currently involved in a bunch of Digital Humanities stuff. Most of the software-type stuff lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/Jmuccigr/), but not all:
    -   [Scripts](https://github.com/Jmuccigr/scripts/) (mostly for cleaning up old scans with ImageMagick)
    -   Some Mac OS X Services
        -   I made up a few Classics-related services. Install them in the Library/Services folder and then find them under the Services submenu in the currently running application’s menu:
            1.  [Convert diaereses](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/services/ConverttoMacrons.service) into macrons (Unicode)
            2.  Look up the selected Latin word in [Whitaker’s free Latin dictionary](http://www.erols.com/whitaker/wordsmac.htm) (which must therefore be installed on your computer as well)
                -   [Form info only](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/services/LookUpinLatinDictionaryforForm.service)
                -   [English meaning only](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/services/LookUpinLatinDictionaryforEnglish.service)
                -   [Entire entry](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/services/LookupinLatinDictionary.service)
            3.  [Look up the selected Latin word](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/services/LookupinLatinPerseus.service) in Perseus’ version of Lewis & Short
            4.  [Look up the selected object](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/services/LookupobjectinPerseus.service) in Perseus’ classical resources (Perseus doesn’t always respond well to this)
    -   Then there’s this keyboard I made up to make typing macrons easier. It’s based on the Mac OS Hawaiian layout, but has the Dvorak layout. Download the whole packet with directions [here](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/latin/DvH.sitx) .
-   Here are some projects that are basically in stasis right now, but involving computer-use in our departmental courses:
    1.  [Image Database](http://www.depts.drew.edu/classics/db.html)
    2.  Michigan-Latin Vocabulary Project
    3.  QuickTime animations
        1.  Latin animations, a [Summer 1999 Drew CINC](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/cinc/) project on word order in Latin
        2.  [Greek colonies in the west](http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/colonies/)
-   My outdated pages on how to use a Mac at Drew are still on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20011001000000*/http://www.users.drew.edu/jmuccigr/mac/), if you’re really interested.
-   Latest causes
    -   “Protocols not platforms”  
        This is a long-running stance of mine on standardization. It needs a good homepage, but for now check out this page:
        -   [Part of a MacCentral series](http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0006/08.dual.shtml) on dual-platform sites. See the list at the bottom of the article.
    -   [RDF](foaf.rdf) of my [foaf](http://www.foaf-project.org/) entry.
