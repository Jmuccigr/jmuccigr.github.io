# CV

This is my CV, which I'm converting to markdown so that I can use pandoc to generate html and pdf from a single file.

- 2015 April 3 - Now successfully generating decent html, though I sacrificed the photo that was in the original.
- 2015 May 29 - Now **really** generating decent HTML. I had missed a bunch of formatting ugliness. Too much HTML in it for my liking, but not sure how to avoid that at this point.
- 2015 August 12 - Fixed a few lingering html-error-making things, along with updates.
- 2015 Sept 10 - Fixed a few things, including another error and moved some text I put in for pdf generation (which I'm doing by print-to-pdf of the html). Going to include the pandoc-generated html version here as well from now on.
    - Wrote new css & shell script to generate two versions at the same time by using different css files. Then realized I could use @media in css to handle print version and re-did my css too.
- 2015 Sept 17 - Switched to using tables instead of html spans. Updated the css too.
- 2015 Sept 19 - Fixed re-broken table under faculty career, including tweaking list in css since markdown can't handle lists in table cells without using html.
- 2015 Nov 5 - Removed duplicate line and unnecessary line break in Education section. Updated last-edited date.
- 2015 Dec 2 - Moved things around in the employment section. Put PBK back into real Greek instead of using math function for latex.
- 2016 sept 5 - Moved this into my github-hosted web space.
