# stuff
A random collection of files I keep in Github.

- CV - This is my CV, which I'm converting to markdown so that I can use pandoc to generate html and pdf from a single file.
  - 2015 April 3 - Now successfully generating decent html, though I sacrificed the photo that was in the original.
  - 2015 May 29 - Now **really** generating decent HTML. I had missed a bunch of formatting ugliness. Too much HTML in it for my liking, but not sure how to avoid that at this point.
  - 2015 August 12 - Fixed a few lingering html-error-making things, along with updates.
