## Intro

Steve Jobs convinced everyone to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) when Apple released the Mac back in 1984. When OS X was released in 2001, the system's operating software was built on top of UNIX, a venerable operating system (OS) invented in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center (Yay, NJ!). This means that a large number of tools and techniques are available for the Mac from this larger computing world.

It also means that we can use a text-based approach to doing things on/with the computer via the *command line*. This is essentially a software application that pretends to be ("emulates") an old, dumb computer terminal. Apple's included app that does this is called (uncreatively), *Terminal.app*. There are several third-party ones as well, including [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html), which has some nice add-ons. The interface these apps provide is often called a *shell*.

## Demo
