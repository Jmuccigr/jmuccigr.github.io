## Prepare your computer

- Back it up! Get some kind of back-up running on your computer.
    - Why? In case:
        1. You screw it up and need to get back to where you were
        1. You somehow lose important data
    - Some options (none of which are free)
        - Apple's Time Machine software
            - Requires an external hard drive
        - An on-line back-up service
            - Requires just an internet connection
    - NB Cloud-based services like DropBox or Box or Google Drive or Apple's iCloud are not really back-up services. If you delete a file on your computer, it will also be deleted in the cloud and you typically can't get it back.
- Get a good text editor
    - [BBEdit](http://barebones.com/) is a classic
