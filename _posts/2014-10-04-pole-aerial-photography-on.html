A <a href="http://urban-archaeology.blogspot.com/2014/09/how-to-make-and-use-pole-mounted-camera.html">recent post</a>&nbsp;by Chiz Howard over at the Urban Archaeology blog covers his efforts to make a pole-mounted camera. I figured I'd share my own experience doing something similar on <a href="http://vicusmartis.blogspot.com/">our site</a> in Italy.<br /><br />I was mainly interested in getting better quality overhead shots for archival purposes, so what I wanted was a camera view of as close to perpendicular to the ground as I could get, and, ideally, from a fairly high vantage point to include as much ground as possible. It turns out—not surprisingly, in retrospect—that there's a whole community of people out there on the internet who do this sort of thing (PAP, for "pole aerial photography, not to be confused with KAP for "kite"), so I didn't need to re-invent the wheel on this.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/Overhead%2Bfun.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="/images/Overhead%2Bfun.JPG" height="300" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Overhead of the crew at work. 5m or so wide.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
