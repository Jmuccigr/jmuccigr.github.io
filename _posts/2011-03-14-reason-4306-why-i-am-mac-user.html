I run Windows XP in <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> on my MacBook. Love it. Almost everything works great. I can save the state of my Windows machine. I can revert to an older saved state. I can run those rare, but enticing, Windows-only apps like ArcGIS, or the DAVID Laserscanner, or the CVA Access database (yuck).&nbsp;But the big reason is that I've needed the latest version of Excel for compatibility with all the nice stuff pivot tables can do on it. (Shout out to pivot-tabler extraordinaire CVW!)<br /><br />So here's the thing: open a file in Excel, make some changes, and then try to close without having saved it. Excel will throw up a dialog box for you to save that file. Cancel the save and it will then ask you whether you want to save this file which you've made changes in.<br /><br />Uh...isn't that backwards? Why don't you ask me first and save a step? You know, like my Mac has done for the past 27 years.<br /><br />Yes, I know this is Excel and not XP, but it's still Microsoft, so same difference.
