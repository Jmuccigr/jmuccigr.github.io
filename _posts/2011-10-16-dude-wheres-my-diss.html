<h2>Part II, in which I wonder about my copyright</h2>As noted <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-09-24-dude-wheres-my-diss %}">last time</a>, I clearly assert my ownership of copyright on the title page of my dissertation. However UMI also asserts a copyright:<br /><blockquote>UMI Microform 9840610 Copyright 1998, by UMI Company, All rights reserved. This microform edition is protected against unauthorized copying under Title 17, United States Code.</blockquote>Honestly I don't know what this means. Sounds like they might claim a copyright on the particular microform instantiation of my dissertation, that is, the microfilm, though given the appearance of this text on a pdf, I suspect they may also be claiming a copyright on that particular pdf as well.<br />Let's see what their website reveals. Off to the support pages and I find <a href="http://support.proquest.com/display/4/kb/article.aspx?aid=1530&amp;n=1&amp;docid=26185&amp;tab=search">this</a> as the second item on a search for "copyright":<br /><blockquote>No, you do not have to copyright your work unless your school requires you to do so.</blockquote>Well, mine did, so that seems to rule me out. Since I don't see any other obvious choices, I guess I'll e-mail support and see what they say. Here's my question:<br /><blockquote>My dissertation cays that I have the copyright, per my university's instructions. The UMI version says that UMI claims a copyright as well, though you also recognize mine. What exactly are the rights that I retain and what are the ones that you hold?<br />Thanks.&nbsp;</blockquote>Two days later (which is actually the first business day after), their reply in its entirety:<br /><blockquote>You are the copyright owner of your dissertation not us</blockquote>So that seems good, but I remain a bit suspicious, given their fairly clear claim, so I ask back:<br /><blockquote>Does that mean I can freely distribute the pdf you made of my dissertation?</blockquote>This time the reply is:<br /><blockquote>You would need to call the copyright office to ask them</blockquote>So I do. The answer from them is that I am free to do what I want with the pdf of the dissertation; that they merely store my work. Awesome.<br /><br />Next up, where to put the diss for long-term availability.
