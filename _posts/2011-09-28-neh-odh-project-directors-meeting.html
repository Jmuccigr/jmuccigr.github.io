Spent the day yesterday with <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/10480131160743773420">Tom Elliott</a> and a slew of other digital humanists(?) at the <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20110922_B.html">NEH Office of Digital Humanities' day-long meeting for project directors</a>. We were talking about our <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/about/news/grant-received-for-linked-ancient-world-data-institute">Advanced Institute on linked open data</a> that's a joint project between <a href="http://www.drew.edu/">Drew University</a> and NYU's <a href="http://isaw.nyu.edu/">ISAW</a>. <a href="http://sebastianheath.com/">Sebastian Heath</a> is the third co-PI, notable by his absence.<br /><br />Loads of fun, and nice to meet a bunch of people IRL whom I know from their work on-line, or Twitter, or some other on-line place.<br /><br />Twitter hashtag&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23SUG2011">#SUG2011</a>.<br />Inside Higher Ed's story is <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/09/28/national_endowment_for_the_humanities_celebrates_digital_humanities_projects">here</a>.
