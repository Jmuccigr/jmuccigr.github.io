Been spending a bunch of time this weekend trying to get another kinect hack running on my MacBook. It requires the <b>other</b>&nbsp;drivers for the kinect, OpenNI. Nifty, but they have some issues with OS X, so I can run them on their own (see that image there), but not with the robot OS (ros) I've been working with and with which a number of these kinect hacks work. Bottom line right now is that I can't make nite inside ros and my weak computer skills are not giving me hope that I won't have to wait until somebody else works this out.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5_mNa4EYkOk/TXWcgMaOtyI/AAAAAAAAANI/IvgR0PYvA6U/s1600/OpenNI_livingroom.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5_mNa4EYkOk/TXWcgMaOtyI/AAAAAAAAANI/IvgR0PYvA6U/s320/OpenNI_livingroom.png" width="320" /></a></div>Still, having a ball playing with the software and watching this whole arena develop in front of my internetworked eyes.
