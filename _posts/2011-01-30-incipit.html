I finally started using <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/JD_PhD/">Twitter</a> last month, and I've been blogging my <a href="http://drewinumbria.blogspot.com/">archaeological excavation in Umbria</a> for a few years now, but then there are all those other things in my life that I feel the urge to write about (which will surprise no one who knows me).<br /><br />So this is the blog for that stuff.<br /><br />I'll see about getting my Twitter feed on here too, for complete social-media redundancy.
