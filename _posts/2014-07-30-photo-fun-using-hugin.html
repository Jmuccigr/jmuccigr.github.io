Back from my annual month in Italy to lead the excavation at the Vicus Martis Tudertium site and it's time to get cracking on various associated tasks. First up is putting together some of the more adventurous photography work I did, including some pole aerial photography (PAP, as they say, about which I'll do another blog post soon) and 3D work.<br /><br />For the 3D work, I've been using the for-pay <a href="http://www.agisoft.ru/products/photoscan/">Photoscan</a> application, which works great for me, especially now that I upgraded my laptop to 16GB of RAM. (I'd like to use a freeware option, like <a href="http://ccwu.me/vsfm/">VisualSFM</a>, but I can't get it to run yet on my MacBook Pro. I'm working on it now that there's a <a href="https://github.com/luckybulldozer/VisualSFM_OS_X_Mavericks_Installer">new installer on GitHub</a>.) The PAP work needs some stitching to create photomosiacs. For that I'm using the freeware <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a>, which is very powerful, but not tremendously well documented, so there's a bit of a learning curve partly due to adapting the old tutorials to the newer versions with their nicer interface.<br /><br />I already got one photomosaic done during the campaign this summer, just to make sure it was going to work. Here's a small version of the photo. You can catch my feet in more than one place:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="/images/2014+-+inscription_blended_fused.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="/images/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/fPjMRItTM4Y?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://www.youtube.com/v/fPjMRItTM4Y?version=3&f=user_uploads&c=google-webdrive-0&app=youtube_gdata" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div>
