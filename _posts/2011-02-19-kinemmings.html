Another nifty looking use of the Kinect involves the Robot OS (ROS) project, which sponsored a contest for a Kinect-based game. The winners were from Mexico and describe their games like this:<br /><blockquote>Fun and Interactive game based on the old famous game lemmings</blockquote>It took me a little doing to get all the various dependencies working, including <a href="http://code.ros.org/lurker/message/20101212.191016.d1b4f2e5.gl.html">modifying some dylibs</a> to get opencv2 working right, and modifying common to get nodelet running. (I apparently have an older version of common, but a <a href="https://code.ros.org/trac/ros-pkg/ticket/4668">single edit to a config file</a> fixed the problem until I do the upgrade.)<br />It now runs for a little bit and then freezes. Not sure why or what it's doing when frozen, but I'll post a screen shot later today.<br />Next up: using the Kinect as a 3D scanner&nbsp;with another contest winner,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni/Contests/ROS%203D/RGBD-6D-SLAM">RGBD-6D-SLAM</a>.
