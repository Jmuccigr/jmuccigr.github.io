I've just spend the time to move my personal blog (which gets erratic attention from me) from that very popular service run by Google to github.io. I'd moved the basic homepage and CV to github months ago, but hadn't gotten around to the blog until now.

I'm using jekyll to generate the website and since it comes with a nice blogging function—and someone else has already made an import function for blogspot—I went ahead and made the move.

It's not perfect. The export process inserted a lot of style formatting, for example, but I've cleaned up the html a bit, and it'll do for now.
