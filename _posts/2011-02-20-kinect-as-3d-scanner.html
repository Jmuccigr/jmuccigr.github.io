Decided that I had mucked around enough in the ros files and that I would re-install the whole darn thing...which seemed a better idea when I started it than when it did an hour later.&nbsp;Note to self: next time write down <b>all</b> the extra tweaks you had to do to make the software install!<br />In the end, things actually seem better, and I didn't have to re-apply a number of the fixes I found just one or two days ago. Loads of fun to be playing around with code that's being updated daily.<br />(For the record though: on the first time around, I had applied <a href="https://trac.macports.org/ticket/20952">this fix</a> for using python 2.6 instead of 2.5 with wxwidgets. Also here's a&nbsp;<a href="https://code.ros.org/gf/project/ros/mailman/?action=ListThreads&amp;mailman_id=8&amp;_forum_action=ForumMessageBrowse&amp;thread_id=57370">patch</a> to the kdl makefile.)
