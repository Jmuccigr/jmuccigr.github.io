The assignment this week is to add some image links and some web links to the document you created last time. The following are some possible sources for images:

- Your own files
- [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/)

## An Example image

This is from Wikimedia Commons. The markdown is:

    [*Caption text*]\(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Greek_bronzes_%281898%29_%2814796532723%29.jpg)"

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Greek_bronzes_%281898%29_%2814796532723%29.jpg)

To get files from the Wikimedia Commons, just click on the "Use this file" link on the image's page and then copy the link for "File URL":
