- [American School of Classical Studies](http://agora.ascsa.net/research) - The Central American archaeological academic/research institution in Greece, with archives and publications.
- [Beazley Archive](https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/pottery/default.htm) - This is a database of ancient Greek pottery housed at Oxford University in England. You can search it anonymously or as a registered user (for free). Registered users can save searches.
- [*Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae*](http://www.limc-france.fr) (LIMC) - "Dictionary of the Iconography of Classical Myth": Good resource for how various characters and elements of myth were portrayed visually. The printed book is in the library's reference section: N7760 .L49. The website is in French, but can be set to show (most) text in English.
- [Online Coins of the Roman Empire](http://numismatics.org/ocre/): a joint project of the American Numismatic Society and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. This is a tool designed to help in the identification, cataloging, and research of the rich and varied coinage of the Roman Empire
- [Coinage of the Roman Republic Online](http://numismatics.org/crro/): an online version of Michael Crawford's 1974 publication *Roman Republican Coinage*, which is still the primary typology used for the identification of Roman Republican coin types
- [Oxford Classical Dictionary](http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.drew.edu/view/10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001/acref-9780199545568): Standard reference work in Classics. The *OCD* provides fairly short, dense entries for a large variety of topics. It is available on-line via the Drew proxy, so you will need to log in if not on campus.
- [PeriodO](http://perio.do): A gazetteer of period definitions for linking and visualizing data
- [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu): A resource mainly for texts, but also for some images, Perseus provides excellent search capabilities in the original languages and in English translation. Of use will be their [Artifact Browser](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifactBrowser) (Perseus provides more than Classical-world resources, so be careful to limit your searches.)
- [Pleiades](http://pleiades.stoa.org): "a community-built gazetteer and graph of ancient places," Pleiades provides information about the location of ancient places of various kinds.
- Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites: a print and on-line resource for, as the title says, Classical sites. Access [on-line via Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/search?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0006).
