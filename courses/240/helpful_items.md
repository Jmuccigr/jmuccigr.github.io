- [Coinage of the Roman Republic Online](http://numismatics.org/crro/){:target="_blank"}: an online version of Michael Crawford's 1974 publication *Roman Republican Coinage*, which is still the primary typology used for the identification of Roman Republican coin types

- [Digitales Forum Romanum](http://www.digitales-forum-romanum.de/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} - A digital model of the Roman Forum from the Winckelmann-Institut of the Humboldt-Universit√§t of Berlin.
- [*Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae*](http://www.limc-france.fr){:target="_blank"} (LIMC) - "Dictionary of the Iconography of Classical Myth": Good resource for how various characters and elements of myth were portrayed visually. The printed book is in the library's reference section: N7760 .L49. The website is in French, but can be set to show (most) text in English.
- [Online Coins of the Roman Empire](http://numismatics.org/ocre/){:target="_blank"}: a joint project of the American Numismatic Society and the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. This is a tool designed to help in the identification, cataloging, and research of the rich and varied coinage of the Roman Empire
- [Oxford Classical Dictionary](http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy.drew.edu/view/10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001/acref-9780199545568){:target="_blank"}: Standard reference work in Classics.

- [Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu){:target="_blank"}: A resource mainly for texts, but also for some images, Perseus provides excellent search capabilities in the original languages and in English translation. Of use will be their [Artifact Browser](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifactBrowser) (Perseus provides more than Classical-world resources, so be careful to limit your searches.)
- [Pleiades](http://pleiades.stoa.org){:target="_blank"}: "a community-built gazetteer and graph of ancient places," Pleiades provides information about the location of ancient places of various kinds.
- Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites: a print and on-line resource for, as the title says, Classical sites. Access [on-line via Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/search?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0006){:target="_blank"}.
