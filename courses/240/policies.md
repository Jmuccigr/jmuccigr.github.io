## Course Policies

### Attendance

This course requires participation. *This is your most important responsibility.* What counts in the course is what we do every day; your grade is weighted to reflect that. Come prepared, having done the reading each day, and engage in the class with informed participation. The more you participate in class, and show that you are prepared and engaged, the better. Absences will hurt your grade. 

### Classroom Etiquette
- Technology: I will trust you to use the technology of your choice as appropriate. For your own learning and that of your fellow students in the course, try not to text/message/Instagram/whatever during class time. Turn off and put away unneeded electronic devices during class.- Please do not walk in and out of the room during class unless it is necessary. You don't need to ask permission.- Feel free to speak to me any time outside of class about the material. Email anytime (though I may not get back to you right away)!

## University Policies

- **Absences** : If you have to miss two or more classes for a necessary reason, use this [Absence Verification Form](https://www.drew.edu/academic-services/forms/absences) to notify the Academic Services office and your professors.
- **Academic Integrity** : All students are required to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty. Any case of academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to the guidelines and procedures outlined in Drew University’s Standards of Academic Integrity: Guidelines and Procedures. A copy of this document is available on the Drew U-KNOW website (under CLA Dean’s Office: “Academic Integrity Standards”).- **Requesting Accommodations**    - **Requesting Accommodations for the First Time**: students are instructed to contact Accessibility Resources, Brothers College, 119B; 973-408-3962. Although disclosure may take place at any time during the semester, students are encouraged to do so early in the semester, because, in general, accommodations are not implemented retroactively. For additional information, visit <http://www.drew.edu/academic-services/disabilityservices>.    - **Returning Students with Approved Accommodations**: Requests for previously approved accommodations for the current semester should be sent to Accessibility Resources ideally within the first two weeks of class. This allows the office sufficient lead time to process the request. Please call 973-408-3962, email [disabilityserv@drew.edu](mailto: disabilityserv@drew.edu), or complete the accommodations request at <http://www.drew.edu/academic-services/disabilityservices/request-for-accommodations>.
